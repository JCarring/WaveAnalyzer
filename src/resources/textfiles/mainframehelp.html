<h1>Wave intensity analysis options</h1>
	There are various ways that wave analysis can be performed. These are:

	<h2><font color='red'>Separate</font> flow and pressure sources (i.e. Doppler FloWire)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Select this option if your pressure and flow data are stored in two separate files (i.e. recorded from
			<strong>two separate wires</strong>)
			You will be prompted to upload two distinct data files: one for the pressure
			readings and one for the flow velocity readings. The application will
			then guide you through the process of performing Wave Intensity
			Analysis (WIA) by combining these two sources.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><font color='red'>Same</font> flow and pressure sources (i.e. ComboWire)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Select this option if your data was recorded concurrently and is in the same file (i.e. <strong>single
				combination wire, ComboWire</strong>). You will be prompted to upload a single data
			file that contains columns for both pressure and flow data.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><font color='red'>Re-analyze</font> prior wave profile</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Choose this option to load a previously saved WIA analysis
			file (a <code>.wia</code> file). This
			allows you to review, modify, or re-run the analysis without having
			to re-upload the original raw data. This is useful for adjusting wave
			selections (or adding new waves), alignment, or analysis parameters.
		</li>
	</ul>
