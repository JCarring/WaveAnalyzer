	<h2>Trim Help</h2>
	It can be helpful to trim the input files. If the input files have a
	large number or frequency of samples, it can cause the Java Virtual
	Machine running this program to run out of free memory and crash. <br>
	
	<br>Trim does <b>not</b> need to be applied. You may choose to skip it.<br>
	<br>Files do <b>not</b> need to be saved, but can be saved if trim is applied.
