<h2>Waves Help</h2>
<p>
Select waves in the top panel to the left. Hover over the graph with your mouse, and a vertical line will appear 
showing position of the mouse related to the axis.

<br><br>
When you have the vertical bar aligned at the beginning of the wave, press the "a" key. Move to the end of the wave 
and repeat the process. Press the "r" key to reset. Once you have found start and end points to the waves, add the wave 
by pressing the "a" key again. You will be prompted to select one of the common wave names, or create your own. Labels 
will then display on the graph indicating your selection.

<br><br>
To add waves faster, you can select the beginning of wave, end of wave, and finalize the wave selection using the following 
keys (in accordance with the natural ordering of waves, systole to diastole, proximal then distal):
