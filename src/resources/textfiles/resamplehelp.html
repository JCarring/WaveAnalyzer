	<h2>Resampling Function</h2>
	<p>The resampling panel allows you to standardize the sampling
		frequency for the two selected data files (e.g., one containing
		pressure data and the other containing flow data). This process is
		essential because the two files may have been recorded at different or
		fluctuating sample rates. By resampling, you create new datasets where
		both signals have data points at the exact same, uniform time
		intervals, which is required for wave intensity calculations.</p>
	<p>
		The user must input the desired sample interval, or period, in <strong>seconds</strong>.
		For example, entering
		<code>0.002</code>
		would resample the data to have a point every 2 milliseconds, which
		corresponds to a frequency of 500 Hz.
	</p>
	<p>This temporal alignment is critical for the subsequent steps in
		the workflow, such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Trimming</strong>: Ensuring that trimming actions
			apply to the same time windows in both datasets.</li>
		<li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Facilitating the accurate
			overlaying of the two signals (e.g., aligning ECG traces).</li>
		<li><strong>Wave Intensity Analysis (WIA)</strong>: Performing
			calculations that require simultaneous pressure and flow values.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The data resampler accomplishes this by using <strong>cubic spline
			interpolation</strong> to calculate the value of the signal at each new,
		required time point. This method fits a series of polynomials to the
		original data, creating a smooth function that can be evaluated at any
		point within the data's time range.
