<h2>Wave Analysis Help</h2>
On the left are graphs of separated wave intensity, pressure and flow, and net wave intensity. Select the appropriate waves 
in the top graph, and select the point of systole and diastole in the pressure and flow graph in order to calculate 
resistance. Use the help buttons on the right panel for further information.

Customize the save settings with menu bar at the top. Save images of graphs using the button on the bottom right panel. 
In addition, there is a selection for serialization of the data. This should almost always be checked, and produces a 
file with extension '.wia' which can be loaded into the system at a later point to modify beat selections.</p>
