<div style='width: 700px; font-size: 12px'>
Below is the sample that you have uploaded, with flow offset as you specified on the main frame. Here you can select beats to be 
ensemble averaged (3 more more beats is recommended, but at least 2 are required).

<br><br>
To navigate the graph:

<ul>
<li>Use the mouse wheel to scroll in and out (does not work well with track pads)</li>
<li>Click and drag to pan forward and backward on the graph (once you have zoomed in)</li>
</ul>
<br>
You can select waves manually, or automatically if there was R peak data in the data you uploaded (i.e. column of data 
with 1 indicating peak, 0 or empty for no peak):

<ul>
<li><b>Manual:</b> Find the beginning of the R wave upstroke on the chart, hovering your mouse somewhere vertically over this point, then press "1". Find 
the end of the beat cycle and press "2". Then press "3" to record the beat. Beats can be deleted at the bottom.</li>
<li><b>Automatic:</b> If your raw data contained R peak indicators, you can automatically select beats. Click the checkbox at the bottom to sync 
clicks with the nearest R wave markers. Then simply press 1, 2, or 3 with mouse hovering somewhere between the beat (vertical position does not matter). It 
is recommended that you zoom in to verify the proper positioning of the r wave markers.
</ul>

Click accept when you are done. you may also reset all of your selections using the reset button at the bottom right.
